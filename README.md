  making yuor own shimeji
  <br><br>
  if you never made a shimeji before, i recommend you to download the original first https://kilkakon.com/shimeji/ <br><br>
  now that yuo got the file, there's 3 things you can customize, <b>img of the shimeji, behaviors, and actions</b><br><br>
  if you know more technical stuff, you can def customize even more but idk anything about it so wtv<br><br>
anywayz, the image size is usually 128x128px, you can use the template in the original file as a guide, you can change the animation too in the action.xml using code editorz
  <br><br>
im still kinda scared to even touch the action.xml tho, xml is almost like html but you basically can make your own tags, but shimeji still only accept certain tags and even a single error could be fatal so... yea
  <br><br>
  i have a few great tutorials for customizing your own shimeji<br>first we got this cool YouTuber by the name <b>rinspirit_art</b> who made these vidz https://youtu.be/xVCYm8kZn1g?si=t_MZ4BV7Ho7ws9ik
  <br><br>
  then we got this post on Tumblr that i find really useful as a guide, it also have a part 2 in the post https://aki-appeared-and.tumblr.com/post/93795517328/i-find-most-shimeji-tutorials-focus-a-little-to
